# Proyecto-UIDE

The objective of the project is to develop a predictive model to identify possible students interested in entering a higher education institution based on previously carried out marketing campaigns. To guarantee data privacy, we worked with synthetic data generated from real historical patterns and the anonymization of personal data, which allowed scenarios to be simulated without compromising the confidentiality of the information. 

The methodological approach was based on collecting various data sources, including social media interactions, demographic data, visits, and phone calls, which were in a CRM. From these data, a prediction model was built that allows potential students to be segmented and classified according to their probability of enrollment. 

The implementation of the model was carried out using machine learning tools that allowed different algorithms to be evaluated to find the most suitable one in terms of precision and performance. The techniques evaluated included KNN, decision trees and neural networks, with Random Forest being the model selected for its robustness and ease of interpretation in this context.
